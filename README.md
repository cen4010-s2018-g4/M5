1) Name of the product
2) Explicit list of ALL major committed functions. These are your FINAL Priority 1 functions for which you will be graded and that your team shall actually deliver and test for. You should use plain English as if you would talk to a customer, and not the language used for formal requirements specification. This is your FINAL functional commitment. In other words, failure to deliver on some of Priority 1 functions will result in reduced grade. Please write it in the list format (each item max 1-3 lines) so it is easy to check.
3) Describe unique features in your product (if any)
4) URL to your product accessible to instructors, on deployment server
Length: max 1 page. Write it for wider audience: executives, marketing, customers.
The list of final functions will be checked on your final delivery for functionality and correct operation as you specified them. Failure to deliver complete list of these committed functions may result in reduced grade.

### 3.6 Team members contribution

1) List each team members’ contribution to the project. Use “Project Peer Evaluation” (posted on Canvas under “Resources”), to give each team member’s contribution points. Note: All team members should reach consensus of those points.
2) Describe each team members contribution to teamwork (technically and any other contribution). No more than half page. Bulletin format is fine
3) Number of submissions each team member made to GitHub team development branch


### 3.7 Post-project analysis (one page or so)

In many organizations, after the project is finished, people engage in analysis of the experience, issues, and lessons learned. In the classroom, one often learns more from mistakes. But for real learning to happen, one needs to be able to understand what mistakes were made and what would need to be done to avoid them in the future. BTW: this is also worthy of discussion in your job interviews – employers love those real stories about challenges and how there were dealt with.
In about one page team lead should summarize: a) main challenges; and b) what would you do better next time to address those challenges. Team lead should consult with team members before completing this task. Please be honest and identify issues and mistakes, this will help your learning. <br>
Also include:
1) Features you have finished and those you’d like to finish but couldn’t be able to, and the reasons
2) Knowledge gained and lessons learnt from your project and teamwork
