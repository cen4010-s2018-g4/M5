Main challenges

Working together with 401 to realize this project was a big experience for everyone. First we need to recognize the effort that everyone put together to make this happen. The goal of this project is to make a connection with everyone at the university including student and staff members with our “Campus Snapshots” web application. This project was challenging in multiples area.  Project Management helped keep this project together. 
Halfway in the project we had a time management issue due to work overload. Some of the team members had to step in to help the members that were struggling. Therefore, the team had to revise tasks distribution among members.  
This issue affected the skill performance for some of the team members. We proceeded with reassessing each member’s skills and reassigning the tasks thereby ensuring timely completion of the application. 
The team was faced with communication issues. Each member had a personal schedule different than the other. It made it difficult for us to arrange group meetings as frequently as it should have been. This created a lack of communication between group members. We addressed this issue by modifying our goal to have tasks completed before due date. This gave us ample time to review each member’s work before submitting the project as a whole.

What will we do better next time to address these challenges?

To address these challenges in the future we should do the following. Before starting the project we should develop a workable project schedule that gives us time to constantly track our progress for better transparency. We should have reliable meeting expectations. Finally, using effective communication skills is one of the key tools that will ensure the success of the team in delivering a project that will guarantee satisfied and happy customers.
